After this, they asked me questions related to OOPs, CN and OS. After this, he started asking me questions related to Projects, which even I was hearing for the first time, however, I did answer, as the tech stack was familiar.
    </p></div>
    <div class="page"> <p class="text">But when he specified the tech stack for next project, I was sure this wasn't my project, I polietly requested him to recheck the resume, after which we came to know that he accidently mismatched the resume, I took a sigh of relief.  And then I regained my lost confidence, and explained my rest of the projects, and how there was a tech stack similarity between the other guy's resume! After this they asked if I had any queries for them.</p></div>
    <div class="page"> <p class="text">(P.S Do your homework here!) - I asked him that since they are using Hadoop as their tech stack, why was NO question even near to Hadoop/DS in the interview and he explained that they don't expect interns to know that.
